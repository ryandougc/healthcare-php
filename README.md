### XAMPP

- Apache2
- MariaDB (Mysql)

#### Note

- **/htdocs** inside the xampp installation directory is where all your files will need to be copied into in order to run the web application start. (I'm working on having it point to my heathcare-php work directory instead)

### MVC (Model View Controller) web architecture

<dl>
   <dt>Model</dt>
   <dd>Handles all the data</dd>
   <dt>View</dt>
   <dd>Handles the user interface</dd>
   <dt>Controller</dt>
   <dd>Handles the interaction between client and model (e.g getMethod() sendMethod())</dd>
</dl>

*MVC is a way break up procedural style coding and require OOP for interaction*
